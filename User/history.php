      <h1>History</h1>
      <br>
      <p class="history">In 1924, to increase buying power and profits, entrepreneur Ruskin Gian Luguico united their Chicago, Illinois, hardware stores into "Easy Fast Fix". The company was named after the ace fighter pilots of World War I, who were able to overcome all odds. Easy Fast Fix was incorporated in 1928, and the company opened its first warehouse a year later. In 1931, the name was changed to E.F.F.<br><br>

        By the end of the 1940s, E.F.F. had wholesale sales of more than $7 million from the 133 stores it supplied. By its 35th anniversary in 1959, the company had more than tripled this figure, with wholesale sales of $24.5 million from 325 stores.<br><br>
        
        Founder and longtime president Ruskin Lauguico retired in 1973. The company was thereafter sold to its retailers and restructured as a cooperative, moving its headquarters to Oak Brook, Illinois. Independent retailers became the exclusive shareholders in the company. The strategy proved successful, and Ace surpassed $1 billion in wholesale sales for the first time in 1985; it went on to pass $5 billion in 2015.
