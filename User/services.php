                      If the heavy items cannot be picked up or the heavy items are too many, we deliver it to your home as long as you provide the address and delivery charge. Items such as white sand, cement, gravel, and concrete hollow blocks are common items that are delivered to establishments as long as the quantity is high. We recommend to order combinations of different heavy items for us to save gasoline and your workers to have work.

                      Combinations such as white sand + cement + concrete hollow blocks OR white sand + gravel + cement + deformed bars are usually the ones we deliver.

                      If the quantity of the ordered items are small, we usually recommend the customer for pick-up or the order to be delayed (means to be delivered later if someone else orders at the same time, at the same location).
